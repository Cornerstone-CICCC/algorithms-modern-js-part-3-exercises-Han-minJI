// Exercise 1: Spread Operator
// Instructions: Create an array named `numbers` with some initial values. 
// Then, create a new array named `newNumbers` that includes all elements from the first `numbers` array and adds a few more numbers at the end. 
// Finally, log `newNumbers` to the console.



// Your code here
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 5, 2];
const newNumbers = [...numbers, 4, 7, 3]

console.log(newNumbers);
